WEB-230 | How PHP Works – Server Side Scripting – Assignment
Explain the following:

Identify and explain the differences between server side and client side.

Server side is access to absolutely everything on a site. This is the code they write and all of the documents that go with it and allows
them to control what clients see. The client side is that they only see what code is sent to them and they can only edit what the server 
side allows them to edit. 

Identify and explain the differences between scripting and programming languages.
Scripting does not need to be compiled and might run a bit slower, they automate program tasks and are less code intensive.
Programming languages compile first using native coding language as a base and they run faster with call based actions.
They are also ran in parenting script programs.

Explain what type of language PHP is.
It is an open source language used for general purpose web development. It s executed on the server instead of client side and delivers the 
results to client side.

Explain the process of a request from client to server and back to client.
A client sends out a request for a page. Next it runs through the internet to the server and the server then processes the request and
triggers a function to fulfill the request using service functions. It sends it to a file, the file has a function and grabs documents
and databases and then returns them to the client as a single document.

Explain the differences between the different post types discussed in the video.
GET is in the url, has length restriction, shows up to the client, and can be bookmarked. POST is in the body, does not stay in browser
history, and have no length restriction.
